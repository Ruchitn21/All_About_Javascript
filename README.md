# 1 : Arrays
=> Arrays in Javascript are used to store more than one value. Ex. [1,2,3,4]. There are various operations performed on arrays

   i) Pop -> Pop is used to remove last element of the array. The popped array can also be stored in a variable.
   
   ii) Push -> Push is used to append an element in the array.
   
   iii) Shift -> Shift method is used to remove the element at the first index of the array and shift the rest elements to the lower index. Shift method also return the element removed
                 Ex. arr= [1,2,3,4] -> after arr.shift() -> [2,3,4]

   iv) Unshift -> Unshift method is used to add an element at the starting position of the array and unshifts the older elements to higher index
                 Ex. arr = [1,2,3,4] -> after arr.unshift(7) -> [7,1,2,3,4]
